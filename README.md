# obsidian-vault-schema
## A universal Obsidian vault schema derived from schema.org

As a long-time user of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) Note-taking App, I decided in 2022 that I wanted to settle on a structured approach to notetaking and after reviewing optons from [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org) to [Schema.org](https://schema.org) I decided on the latter.

As such I have used the system as my sloe notes repository for over two years before I felt comforatble about offerring it as a solution for others. In the last two years I have used this format to conduct research, write articles and publish my latest book the [Gospel of Being](https://www.johnmackay.net/gospel-of-being.htm). I also use it to journal, records tasks from shopping lists to project planning such as book marketing and Landing Page design etc.

My vault of 2 years weighs in at around 3GB as I'm a bit of a Magpie using it as a private Pinterest for my favourite shiny things such as aricraft, bikes, boats, cars etc. Don't judge, it's how I unwind. ;>

### Overview
- All file names use TitleCase for portability and ease of readability;
- Use what you need and ignore what you don't;

### Plugins
- Advanced Tables;
- Auto Note Mover;
- Data View; and
- Paste Image Rename

### Note
This is a work in progress so if this looks unfinished it's because it is as I'm doing it in my spare time.
